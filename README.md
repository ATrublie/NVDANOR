Night Vision / Day and Night classification / Object recognition

The day/night image dataset consists of 200 RGB color images in two categories: day and night. There are equal numbers of images for each category.

I build a classifier that can accurately label these images as day or night, and also implemented ResNet for object detection in that pictures as well as VGG for training on this model and being able to clasiffy them. This model relies on finding distinguishing features between the two types of images!

Note: All images come from the AMOS dataset (Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes).

Al the code can be found in NVDANOR.ipynb
